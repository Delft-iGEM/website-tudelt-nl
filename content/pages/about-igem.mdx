# About iGEM

As a student team competing in iGEM, we're thrilled to be part of the largest synthetic biology community and the most exciting competition in our field. iGEM isn't just a contest; it's a journey that inspires us to learn, innovate, and push the boundaries of synthetic biology.

We're following in the footsteps of over 60,000 brilliant young scientists and engineers who have participated in iGEM since its inception. It's humbling to think that this all started back in 2003 with a small course at MIT where students designed biological systems to make cells blink. From those modest beginnings with just 5 teams in 2004, iGEM has grown into a global phenomenon with 350 teams from more than 40 countries!

As a team, we're excited to contribute to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, an open library that's at the heart of iGEM's mission to advance synthetic biology. We're not just competing; we're part of a movement that's shaping the future of this field.

The competition has evolved significantly over the years. It spun out of MIT in 2012, becoming an independent nonprofit organization. We've heard stories from older students about the days of regional competitions, but now we're all working towards the Giant Jamboree - the grand event where all teams come together to showcase their projects.

One of the things we love about iGEM is its inclusivity. Since 2015, both college and high school teams have been competing side by side, with various tracks to accommodate different project focuses. It's inspiring to know that we'll be part of what has become the largest gathering of synthetic biologists in the world.

As we prepare for our iGEM journey, we're not just thinking about the competition. We're excited about the learning opportunities, the chance to innovate, and the potential to make a real impact in the field of synthetic biology. Who knows? Maybe our project will be the next big breakthrough that changes the world!
