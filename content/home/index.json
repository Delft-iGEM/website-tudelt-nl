Since its \ninception in 2004, iGEM has grown to involve hundreds of teams from \nuniversities and research institutions worldwide. It brings together \nstudents from diverse academic disciplines to create innovative \nsolutions to pressing global challenges.\n\nParticipants\n tackle real-world issues like bioremediation, disease treatment, food \nsecurity, and environmental sustainability. By combining experimental \nbiology with computational tools such as modeling and software \ndevelopment, iGEM projects uniquely blend life sciences, engineering, \nand social impact.\n",

Design, Build, Test (Summer): Over the summer, teams develop and refine their synthetic biology systems.\n3. Giant Jamboree (Fall): Held\n    in Paris, France, this event is the culmination of iGEM. Teams present \n   their work to a global audience, compete for awards, and receive \n   feedback from leading experts in the field.\n",
