DNA phages can be kept at much higher temperatures (room temperature) than mRNA vaccines are (-80°C). They don't require nearly as much chemical processing. And they don't require an injection, but can be taken orally. This makes our platform ideal for fighting bird flu, neglected tropical diseases or the next pandemic.\n",
